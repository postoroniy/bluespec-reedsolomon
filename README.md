## Top level files

- for the decoder: mkReedSolomon.bsv
- Top level testbench: mkTestbench.bsv

## Testbench

Test file is generated by python, where 2 symbols are corrupted, which for
decoder RS(255,251) should not be the issue to recover. The testbench reads
the corrupted data from the file input.dat (with the first 2 terms being 'n' and
't' parameters) and writes the decoded output to output.dat.
If files output.dat and ref_output.dat are matched simulation deemed to be
successful.

## Synthesys

Yosys is used for synthesys and estimation of FFs, LUTs and etc.
Default FPGA family is "Ultrascale Plus" can be changed in `ys` file.

## Installations required:

- Bluespec compiler
- yosys for synthesys

## What is missed

All C sources of RS decoder were removed and model of decoder in python is in progress.
